I created shell scripts to run each testcase.
There is a define on scull.h which I used to set how much items I want to read 'NITEMSTOREAD'.

Testcase #1
It is working as I expected. The buffer which has the size of 20 will be full and it won't exit the producer.
When I call the consumer it will read the buffer in order and write it on the terminal and then the producer will write
the rest into the buffer and when all was written it will finished.

Testcase #2
The producer will stay stuck because the buffer can store just 20 items. When we read 10 items by the consumer
we will store 10 more items in the buffer. However, it won't end and stay stuck because it needs to store more 20 items
and there is no space.

Testcase #3
It will produce 20 items and then wait for the consumer read. After all 50 items were produced the producer will be finished.
However, the consumer will be waiting for more 50 items.

Testcase #4
There are 2 scripts, One for the producer 1 and other for the producer 2.
both producers and the consumer exit normally after this test.

Testcase #5
All consumers and the producer exit normally after this test.

Testcase #6
Both producers stay waiting for buffer space when the consumer is finished.

Testcase #7
The consumer stay waiting for more 100 items and both producers finished without problems.
